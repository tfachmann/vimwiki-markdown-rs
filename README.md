# VimwikiMarkdown-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tfachmann/vimwiki-markdown-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tfachmann/vimwiki-markdown-rs)

This project is meant to be a port of [VimwikiMarkdown](https://github.com/patrickdavey/vimwiki_markdown) written in Ruby.
It should be used together with the awesome Vim plugin [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and renders VimWiki pages to markdown.
It is currently a WIP and more of a study side project to get comfortable with Rust.
